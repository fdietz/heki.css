# heki.css
A simple responsive boilerplate to kickstart your project.

heki.css provides a minimal set of styles for a clean start at only *2kb gzipped*.
It is intentionally not a UI framework and a great start if you feel that you don't need all the functionality provided by a larger framework.

## Motivation
* Using CSS variables (for example: --primary-color: blue)
  * Simplifies customizing of boilerplate
  * Offers easy themeing capabilities
  * Change via Javascript
* Consistenly using margin-bottom only (even in reset)
* Responsive font-size using a modular type scale
